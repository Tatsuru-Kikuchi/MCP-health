# MCP-health: AI Productivity Analysis for Medical Fees in Japan

## Overview

This project analyzes the potential productivity gains and cost reductions from implementing AI in Japan's healthcare system, with a focus on administrative automation and efficiency improvements. As one of the world's most rapidly aging societies, Japan faces significant challenges in healthcare costs and workforce shortages, making AI implementation a critical strategy for sustainable healthcare delivery.

## Key Findings Summary

### Current Healthcare Landscape
- **Population aging**: 29.1% of Japan's population is 65+ years old
- **Medical expense burden**: Patients typically pay 30% of medical fees
- **Administrative efficiency**: Japan already has remarkably low administrative costs at 1.6% of total healthcare expenditure
- **Future projections**: Medical care expenditure expected to reach 58.9-64.2 trillion JPY by 2050
- **Workforce shortage**: Expected shortage of nearly 500,000 healthcare workers by 2025

### AI Implementation Impact
- **Administrative time reduction**: 40-60% reduction in administrative tasks
- **Error reduction**: 70-80% decrease in coding and billing errors
- **Processing speed**: 3-5x faster claim processing
- **Patient throughput**: 20-25% increase in patient capacity
- **Overall cost reduction**: 15-25% reduction in total healthcare costs
