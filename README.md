Productivity Analysis enhanced by AI on the medical bills in Japan.

As one of the top aging countries, Japan faces problems increasing the total amount of medical expenses. Most of the patients need to pay 30% of medical fees in Japan. In fact, Salaries don't increase even though prices are going up. The burden of medical costs is a major concern for many families in Japan. 

Taking those situations into accounts, recent progresss of AI might help medical fees by the automation of administrative works, powers of generative AI might reduce the costs and enhancing the productivity. I would like to make aalysis by comparing with and without using AI for the productivity analysis of medical fees in Japan by the use of actual data.
